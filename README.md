# Network-Shared-USB-with-PHP
php project to download and upload files to a usb drive connected to a server, accessible over local network.

The project was created and tested on both a windows machine with xampp localhost, and a raspberry pi using lighttpd.

For the project to work correctly, the server running the php must have relevant file permissions, otherwise the usb cannot be interacted with.
